        Snoopy is not your average beagle. He is a book lover and a book writer. He is a collector 
        of fine art and a root beer connoisseur. Plus, his unstoppable imagination helps keep his 
        life anything but ordinary. As the Flying Ace, he heroically battles the Red Baron. As
        Joe Cool, he is the big dog on campus. But no imaginary adventure matches a nap on his 
        doghouse—and waking up to a well-deserved supper made especially for him by that Round-Headed
        Kid. To learn more about Snoopy's beginnings, be sure to read
